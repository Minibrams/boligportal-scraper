# Boligportal scraper
Scrapes the BoligPortal site for the newest apartment entries and plays a sound when a new apartment below a given price point is found.

## Prerequisites 
Install the Python packages with `python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

You need the Selenium WebDriver to run the program since it loads content with JS. There are many ways to install this, but I used `npm install phantomjs`.
